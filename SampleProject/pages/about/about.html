    <p>My name is Matthew Bailey. I have been working as an ophthalmic technician. I have not been happy with where I was at in my career because I felt I was nothing more for me to learn. 
        After 6 years I peaked unless I went back to school to become a doctor. While I love learning at this point in my life I wasnt able to commit to another 8+ years of schooling.
        All of my friends are working in the tech industry, whether it is IT, software development, or management. So I have learned some information about coding here and there and have really enjoyed it.
        I started looking for schools back in August. Most of what I found were bootcamps that cost 10 thousand dollars or more! I was telling my friends about my disappontment when my friend Steven told me about mtech.
        I love how I get the benefit of an in classroom experience, the high quality of teaching, while also getting it for an affordable price. Also the externship is something I am very excited about.
